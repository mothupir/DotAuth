<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


DotAuth is an Identity and Access Management platform for businesses built on the Moonbeam EVM Blockchain. Our solution makes it easier to manage access to proprietary systems and software. The current MVP allows organizations to create access rules and assign them to users. Our plan is to incorporate an AuthWallet in the next iteration to provide users with a secure way to store all their access tokens.

Here's why:

* DotAuth provides added security to organizations by removing a lot of the administration around access management. The AuthWallet allows users to store all their access tokens in one secure place. The DotAuth platform also ensures that access rules and tokens are updated regularly, minimizing the chances of unauthorized access. This provides businesses with peace of mind and a secure environment for their users.

* DotAuth has a range of features that make it a great choice for businesses looking for an Identity and Access Management solution. It provides a secure way to store access tokens, and allows organizations to update access rules regularly. DotAuth also allows users to easily manage their access tokens, and provides businesses with a secure environment for their users. It also has a range of customization options to suit the needs of any organization.


The future of DotAuth is bright. We plan to incorporate additional features and customization options to ensure that it meets the needs of any organization. We are also looking into incorporating additional security measures to provide businesses with even more peace of mind. We are also looking into developing more advanced features such as an artificial intelligence-based access control system, and a system for managing access to cloud-based services. This will help to ensure that DotAuth remains a secure and reliable Identity and Access Management platform for businesses.
